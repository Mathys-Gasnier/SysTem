# SysTem

A system command bar that aims to speed up my workflow.

At the moment the package doesn't aim the "general user" and is more focused on my specific needs.

**! Probably not linux compatible at the moment !**

## Features

- Integrated calculator (Done with the [evalexpr](https://docs.rs/evalexpr/latest/evalexpr/) crate)
- Quick command execution (Windows specific)
- WSL quick start (Windows specific)
- Not so smart git ghp key manager (Not tested on Linux)
